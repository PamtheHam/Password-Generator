# Password-Generator
In this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a password generator. The password generator is able to collect information from the user in order to determine the parameters of the password. This includes a minimum of 8 character and a maximum of 128 characters and the choice of at least one type of character: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Once the user chooses a password length, they are given the option to choose at least one type of character or as many of the four as they want. When that information is collected, the user presses on the "Generate Password" button, and a password that fits their specified criteria is written on the page.
