# Password-Generator
In this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a password generator. The password generator is able to collect information from the user in order to determine the parameters of the password, including a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters and the choice of at least one type of character: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers, though the user may choose all four types. When that information is collected, the user presses on the "Generate Password" button, and a password that fits their specified criteria is written on the page.
